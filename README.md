# SilentOwner
SilentOwner is a stealthy LDAP post-exploitation tool that lets you change the OwnerSID of any AD object—like a user or group—if you have WriteOwner rights. It operates over LDAP using proper SDFlags, enabling silent ownership takeover and privilege escalation without triggering alerts.
